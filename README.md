# kr_redm_hangings

RedM Hangings, majority of it still works but rope and trap door is not synced since OneSync.

- Player stands at trap door to put head in noose
- Second player pulls lever to open trap door and hang player
- Player will hang for a while before eventually being killed
- Standalone works regardless of framework
